So after the zoo, we went to a party at the Sentosa island. we rode by bus from NTU to Sentosa, and from the buses, we walked ca 1 km to the beach right outside the place where the party was going to be held. The sea water was warm, and I first though that all the lights I saw across the water were from houses on some other island. Turns out, it was freighters anchoring just out the shore of Singapore. Oh, and we could also see the port from this beach. All in all, not a really good view.

Anyways, we stood in line for 20 minutes, and I at first thought it would be an indoor party, but it turned out to be something much, much better. It was an outdoor party with a dance floor, a lounge area, a game section, and a pool. I don't like the usual club, where you can't hear anything except the music, and where everything is about dancing, so this was perfect! We grabbed our free drinks (we get them from buying a ticket in), and sat down by a lounge group, where we could enjoy watching everyone else stand in a huuuge line to get their free drinks.

Later on, our group seemed to split up into smaller and smaller fractions, and the remains of us, i.e. me, Diego the Spanish and Abi the Brit, started wondering where the rest had disappeared off to. Then we found out, through Nina the Norwegian, that there was a game section in the night club, where if you won a game, you would get a free drink. Hearing about this, we immediately headed off there, and managed to win 2/3 games, thanks to Abi, who was really good at throwing ping-pong balls in mini-treasure chests.

Later on, I also saw some other friends at the party. Some honorable mentions are "Lukas the Austrian dude", "Sara av Link√∂ping" who convinced me to get a tattoo at the party (yes, you could do that), "Theresa the Austrian dudette who studies in Switzerland but is actually studying in Singapore now", and the scandinavian people who I don't really know.

Later on still, Abi held a great speech, which convinced me to go into the pool with all my clothes on me. I stuck to an inflatable duck, hoping that would keep me dry, but a girl kept on pushing me over, so I got soaking wet :(. You can really see the tears in my eyes below after having been pushed over the second time. After that, I got mad and flipped over 4 people myself! Revenge is sweet sometimes..! Especially when it's towards random people who had nothing to do with it in the first place!

Anyways, the night sort of ended there for me. There was nothing much happening from that point on, except nice conversations and walking with massive steps to the bus, as I tried to get there as quickly as possible without running, because I was still a bit sick. Oh, and also, Abi shared some chicken she had bought, which really wasn't chicken. It could not have been chicken. It tasted something different. Something suspicious. But we ate it all up anyways! The picture below is Diego the Spanish getting a bite of artificial powder called chicken meat!
