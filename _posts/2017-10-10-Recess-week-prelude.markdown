I am back from my recess week in Indonesia now, and I will try to write down most of it within these coming few days. I have been trying to think of a way to describe my travels over there, but have come to the conclusion that it is very hard to put a word into it. The closest description I can think of is a wisening roller coaster ride; it had many ups and downs, with many mixed feelings and experiences, but I am really happy to have done the trip, as it taught me many valuable lessons about people. Also, of course, there was alot of nice beaches and nature involved. For now though, I will leave you with the [Google Photos album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/F7u4H9Nr56Iimmzh1) I made for the trip!
