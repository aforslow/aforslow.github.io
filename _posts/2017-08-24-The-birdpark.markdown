So today, me, Eric Liu, Lukas Wasserthal and Markus Fa went to the birdpark. Apparently, there are 4 major zoo parks/events you can go to here in Singapore. Firstly, there is the birdpark, which we went to today. Secondly, there is the Zoo, to which we'll be going tomorrow. Thirdly, There's the night safari, which we'll go to on Saturday evening. Lastly, there's the river safari, which we have not planned for yet!

Anyways, the bird park was a great deal of fun! Whilst there, we first went on a birdshow, on which a parrot sang happy birthday to an old asian lady in the crowd, among other things. The show ended with a massive amount of flamingos strolling into the arena, making it feel like it all got out of hand.

A few minutes later, I apparently stand on the stage of the next bird show, which was about big predator birds. I put my hand up for volunteering and got to feed some sort of vulture under a couple of minutes of awkwardly answering the host's questions. I think the rest of the gang managed to snap some pictures of it, but unfortunately I do not have any. Anyways, here's an american eagle that I took a picture of!

After this novel experience, we went to a part of the birdpark with an artificial waterfall. I managed to get pooped on once (yaay), and thankfully managed to dodge a huuuge pile (bucket? How do you say it when it is bird poop?) of shit from a sadistic big bird sitting 10 m above the path.

After this, we managed to find my favorite part of the park, where we managed to get really close up to some really tame tropical birds. Lukas had a parrot climbing on him, as well as some other kind of bird (crazy bird) that licked Lukas' sweat as if it was the last meal before death row. I myself had some red kind of bird climbing on me, and it thankfully did only what it was supposed to do!
