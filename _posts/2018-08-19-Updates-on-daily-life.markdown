So I have been a bit bad at writing on this blog these couple of days, since it's a lot to deal with social life and course registration. Anyways, I am down to having Fridays free, with one class on Thursdays. I will now try to also get Thursdays free. The courses I will read are, thus far:

* Squash
* Energy Resources Management
* German Language Level 1
* Fundamentals of intellectual property in Materials Science and Engineering
* Introduction to databases

I am planning on dropping Introduction to databases, as this is the only course I have with lectures on Thursdays. Instead of this course, I might read a PG course in Machine Vision (kind of cool, right?) or find some good course that fills up my Tuesdays with more work. More of this will have to be decided next week, though. The course registration doesn't work on weekends.

Regarding my social life, the networking flow is decelerating a bit now. I've noticed that I am less eager to reach out to new friends, and that others are a bit the same. I still meet new people every day, but it's harder to get myself into the same social mode as before, where I wanted to network every minute of every day. Anyways, I met some Swedish people yesterday when we went to an all white party at a club in the city center. Don't worry, it was an all-white clothes party. I found out that many people hang around Canteen 2 on campus before they go partying, and I really liked it there, as I could talk to people and utilize my charisma to the fullest. Going to the club was the worse part of the evening, as dancing is not my good side, and I always get confused and tuned down by the decadence of night clubs and how you're supposed to act in there. Not really my arena, but I go to clubs here to learn how to enjoy them more when I get back home to Sweden. Also, Singapore is a club city for the night life, so I kind of have to do this if I want to get the local experience!

Oh, and regarding the Swedish people, I hung out with some of them and another friend of mine at the pool all day earlier today. In the evening, we went to the city center to try fish head and chili crab, as well as to see the light show by the marina bay. The city is beautiful at night!

Earlier this week, I also tried out water polo with a gang of 20 ripped men in their prime years  of their life, and me. We started the training session by swimming as fast as we could in free swim, breast swim and butterfly swim. I couldn't do butterfly swimming, but I tried anyways. I tried to race the others, but what should you expect when you're competing against an Imperial College student with years of competitive training in butterfly swimming in his pocket? All of this led to me needing to take a 10 minute break after 10 minutes of training, and I thought about quitting then and there. Luckily for me, that was the hard part of the training, and the rest was basically practice with ball in the pool. I also saw, in the middle of the session, that another group started to play kayak polo in the other pool halfway through the training, which I am going to participate in next Tuesday (yay)!

Even earlier this week, on Monday, I got to see the Swedish principal of this school. He held an introductory speech followed by Singaporean national propaganda songs from some half-decent school band. I should talk to him sometime. Would be kind of cool to get to know someone with such great influence and achievements in his pocket. He also seems like a pretty nice principal!

Oh, and this last picture is of this cleaning lady who was going up in the elevator, pushed 2 buttons for some floors, and then left it. All before I went up in it... Some people just want to watch the world burn..!
