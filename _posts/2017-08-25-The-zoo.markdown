So today we went to the zoo, which was a quite large one. There were alot of new species for me to see here; especially monkeys, as I have not seen many different kinds of species of these before. Turns out they had alot of them, and not only that; they had giraffes, lions, lizards, turtles, weird kinds of pigs; yeah, even a polar bear and seals!

First thing we did here was actually to watch a polar bear swim around in a pool. It was a sick polar bear. And a blind one - at least on one of its eyes. But hey, I saw a polar bear 130 km north of the equator. Not sad at all!

Anyways, we kept on going on a couple of more shows throughout the day, but watching animals started getting a little bit boring after having been to the birdpark yesterday. Therefore, I will only provide pictures and videos about the rest of the zoo below.

Oh, and we also saw some living stick creatures. Both me and Markus got to have a couple of them walking on our hands!
