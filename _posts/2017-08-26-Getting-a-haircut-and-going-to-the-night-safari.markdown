So today I went to Boon Lay to get a haircut. Apparently I have not had one in two months, so it was really necessary to get rid of some hair. We have a Korean haircutter on Campus, but apparently he is not good at all, so I went with Timothy the Swiss dude's advice, and took the 199 bus to Boon Lay, and got a haircut at Hairlicious. It was really hard to find the place, as I had to search the bottom- and mid-floors before I finally found it on the third floor. Having found it, I immediately got an appointment and was sat down in front of a mirror to describe my innermost wishes about what was soon about to happen. In other words, I told them I wanted shorter hair, basically. Also, they started laughing when they saw that I probably had not cut my hair in two months. Those bastards...

Anyways, I had a pretty good time there - I got two cups of tea and some oreo cookies, and a hairmassage followed by a hair wash whilst lying down in a chair connected to a tap and bowl/sink. I also had some quite nice conversations with my haircutter who said he is going to Krabi very soon; a place I definitely intend to visit during my stay here. I will probably hear his stories about it in a month when I get my next haircut. He told me he will show pictures of it, anyways! All in all, it was a nice experience, even though I found the people working at the place confusing me at times (it felt as though they talked behind my back sometimes, even though they were quite nice). Anyways, it ended up costing S$33.90, which is quite good in comparison to Sweden, where you would probably pay upwards of S$40 for the same service. Below is a comparison before/during/after the haircut!

In the evening, me, Lukas and Markus went to the Night Safari to see some more animals. The night safari is basically a zoo that is only open during the evenings. It was the third day of watching animals, so we were quite tired of it already. Also, we entered the zoo around 21, which was too late, apparently. It ended up with us walking around the zoo with very low motivation, trying to see animals that most of the time either were not there or were asleep. The last thing we did before leaving the zoo, was going to the show they had in connection to the zoo. I really hoped that this would improve the experience, but it did not, as it was the same concept of watching animals walk around, some host talking about the animals, and some volunteers getting to do something with the animals (in this case, a chinese kid got to feed an animal). What really did it for me, though, was when they repeated the fact that owls can turn their heads 270 degrees (something they said in another show). All in all, I was not very pleased with the night safari, and as such I am not going to the river safari either, as it will probably also be a disappointment. Anyways, I managed to get some nice pictures of the night safari, as shown below!
