Back in my room here in Singapore now. It has been a long week, with school and trip and trip planning. I am exhausted, but feel very grateful for the weekend we spent in Cambodia. To be honest, it was one of the best ones I have ever had in my life. Such were the words of Eric the kiwi. And so are the words of me now.

Since this weekend contained many story worthy moments, I will divide the writing into more posts, to keep the flow going, as well as to spare my head from exhaustion. Thus, you will only get to read part of the story now.

Before we begin though, I would like to write a little bit more about the first part of the week - the one I spent in Singapore. I started out on Monday by relaxing and not doing much school work, in order to rest from the Melaka trip. Tuesday, it got a bit more hectic, as I planned the Bali trip with Markus the Second dude of Austria, and had to attend two classes immediately after that - something that was very exhausting. Especially when my last lecturer got mad at the class and started talking shit about the class in front of the class when we would not answer his questions. Kudos to him for being honest, though! I still do not like him, though - especially since he rolled his eyes when I finally asked a question.

Moving on, Wednesday got even more hectic, as I started out with Squash at 12.30-15.30. Then I only have one hour to go back home, take a shower, change clothes and go to German class at 16.30-18.00. There is almost no time to eat lunch, and today it was even worse, as I tried to go to the medic center before German class to get Malaria medicine for the Cambodia trip. Turns out they had open until 20.30, so instead I ate a short dinner at the south spine food court (my Machine Vision class starts at 18.30) and headed back to the Medic center again. Turns out the Medic center has a 1 hour queue for medical consultation, so I went to class for 45 min and back to the Medic center to choose the cheapest malaria pills for S$11.20, instead of the slightly more expensive ones at S$84. The only downside is that I now have to take them for 28 days after my Cambodian trip. Anyways, I went back to class and finished at 21.30, at which point I was completely exhausted and zombie walked to Cantine 2 to get a waffle. Getting there, they had just started making the last waffle for the guy in front of me, but when he saw the despare in my eyes after having processed what had just taken place, he let me buy it and took ice cream for himself. Such a kind gesture. I was super happy about that!

The day did not end there, though. When I got back, I had to wash my clothes, pack my things and do some last minute travel insurance shopping, school work, as well as ironing and some other travel preparations. I think I finally got to bed around 02.00. And woke up at 08.00. Following the sleeplessness pattern I had had throughout the rest of the week already.

Needless to say, I was a bit tired even before we started travelling. Owing to this, it feels as if I will have quite a few hectic weeks ahead of me, because of my will to travel around in Asia during the weekends. I am very happy that I got the following courses, though:

* Squash
* German 1
* Energy Resources Management
* Computer Networks
* Machine Vision

The top three are quite easy, as they are undergrad courses. The latter two are quite boring and hard, as they are PG courses. The best thing about all of them, though, is that they give me a workweek reaching from Monday 16.30 - Wednesday 21.30!

Anyways, this was it about the first part of the week. For the next part of the trip, I will give you the [tale of Cambodia](https://photos.app.goo.gl/RiLDgWLahy6cchCD3)!
