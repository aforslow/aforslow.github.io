Hi!

My name is Andreas Forsl√∂w, and this is my NTU travelling blog! In the autumn of 2017, I travelled to Singapore for exchange studies at Nanyang Technological Institute (NTU). This gave me quite a bit of experience of NTU, Singapore and Asia - experience I want to share with you through this travelling blog.

The main purpose of this blog is therefore to work as an easily read guide for future exchange students at NTU and Singapore. Hopefully, you will also enjoy the personal stories I provide along the way!
