Hi!

My name is Andreas Forsl√∂w, and this is my NTU travelling blog! I am travelling to Singapore for exchange studies at Nanyang Technological Institute (NTU) over the Fall of 2017. Being a soon-to-graduate software developer, this is an opportunity for me to both practice coding, as well as sharing my travel experiences!

Hopefully, this blog will be useful for future exchange students at NTU and Singapore. My goal is to provide an easy read-through filled with practical tips and humour about travel locations and everyday life in Singapore. Thus, this also works as an NTU blog!
